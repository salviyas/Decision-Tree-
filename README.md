# Decision-Tree

 Implementing a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset is a common machine learning task. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, which includes three classes of iris plants (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) with 50 samples each, and four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

# Here’s a step-by-step implementation with a brief description:

Load the dataset: Use scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset.
Preprocess the data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model: Use the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn to train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model: Predict the labels for the test set and evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy.
